# Frontend Learning Repository
This repository contains various web pages and small sites I've created while learning and practicing front-end development. These projects may resemble others found on platforms like YouTube, as I have used them as a resource for my learning.

## Technologies Used
- HTML: The foundation of web content structure.
- CSS: Styling language used for designing and enhancing the visual presentation.
- JavaScript: Programming language to add interactivity and dynamic functionality.
- Tailwind CSS: Utility-first CSS framework for rapid UI development.
- Bootstrap: Front-end framework for responsive and mobile-first web design.

## Images & Media
In these projects, I have used images sourced from original websites, valid online sources, or directly from Google. These images are used strictly for educational purposes.

## Learning Sources
Many of these projects were inspired by or recreated from tutorials available on YouTube and other online platforms. They have been instrumental in helping me understand and apply front-end development concepts.
